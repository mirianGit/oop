					<p align="left">For stuffing can take the pork, beef or lamb
						(you can mix pork and beef). Meat for the stuffing should be
						chopped finely with a sharp knife or a heavy crank grinder. Scroll
						onion and mix with stuffing. Add pepper and salt. You can add the
						parsley, coriander, and savory that will Khinkali "Qalaquri." Add
						very cold water (about 1 cup). Water must be dead cold. Dough to
						make very strong. It is best done in three steps. For 10-12 large
						khinkali need to take 4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
						(odorless), 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup ice water (pre-pour the water
						into a glass and throw in a couple of ice cubes). Take a roomy
						enameled bowl through a fine sieve and place 2 cups flour. Add a
						teaspoon of salt, vegetable oil and constantly stirring the whole
						mass of hands (step by step add water). Stir sticky mass crease
						about 15 minutes, until smooth and leave to stand for half an
						hour. After half an hour, add 1-1.5 cups flour. Stir again about
						15 minutes prior to the state when the dough does not stick to
						hands. Set aside the dough for another half hour. After half an
						hour add the remaining flour and still stir for about 15 minutes
						to complete homogeneity. As a result, we get a very stiff dough
						that doesn't stick to hands and bowl. Gather dough into a ball,
						wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes. After
						that, form the dough sufficiently large cylinder and a slightly
						floured. With a sharp knife cut circle of dough, put it on the
						table sprinkled with flour and roll out a circle with a diameter
						of about 15 cm and a thickness in millimeters. If the dough is
						kneaded for a long time, it will never be broken. Now put in the
						middle of the circle a tablespoon of minced meat and begin to turn
						in order to get a bag. Close the throat of the bag much as
						possible. When the pouch is formed, pick bag up by the "neck",
						that he had a little sag under the weight of meat, and finally
						formed a capacity for future stock. Ready khinkali put aside for
						powdered floured surface. Boil a very large pot of water and salt
						it. Please note that khinkali must swim quite freely in boiling
						water, in any case, not to stick together. Lower khinkali one by
						one, in the rapidly boiling water and let's not stick to the
						bottom of the pan. Boil khinkali be from 10 to 15 minutes,
						depending on volume. Eat khinkali to the following rule: Khinkali
						take hold of the "tail", holding with other hand and a bag, first
						drink the broth, hot, fragrant, delicious! And then eat the rest
						of the khinkali, leaving the tail on the plate.</p>
